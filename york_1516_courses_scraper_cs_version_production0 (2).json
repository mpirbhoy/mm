Again, relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of Economic issues and how they can be resolved. The issues and problems covered require functions of more than one variable for their resolution. The notion of Quantity Supplied is combined with the notion of Quantity Demanded and notions of Market Equilibrium are introduced and discussed. Equilibria are evaluated through the introduction of mathematical notions and properties of systems of equations, eventually in matrix form. A deeper understanding of theories of demand (supply) and the foundations of demand (supply) functions is developed through the introduction of mathematical notions of unconstrained and constrained optimization and linear and nonlinear programming. As in AP/ECON 1530 3.0, many topics and issues are addressed and problem framing and problem solving abilities are enhanced.\nPrerequisite: AP/ECON 1530 3.00 or equivalent.

In this course, we explore the issue of youth hopelessness in Canada, in order to understand the experiences of a marginalized group of young people, how we have responded to the problem, and how we might work differently to have a significant impact on solutions.

For each idea/topic/problem relevant mathematical ideas and techniques are recalled and/or derived so as to provide a deeper understanding of the Economic issue and how it can be resolved, if necessary. The notion of Quantity Demanded is first addressed by expressing quantity demanded as a linear function of price where both the slope and intercept embed important Economics ideas. This sequence leads naturally to the notion of Revenue (the product of quantity demanded and price) where nonlinear functions are analyzed using mathematical techniques that include derivatives. This sequence culminates with notions of prices that maximize revenue subject to a given demand function. A large number of such topic sequences involving univariate functions are examined.\nPrerequisite: Grade 12U Advanced Functions or equivalent. \nPrerequisites/Co-requisites: AP/ECON 1000 3.00 or AP/ECON 1010 3.00, or equivalent.

      "This course continues the separation of concern theme introduced in EECS1020 and EECS1021. While EECS1020 focuses on the client concern, this course focuses on the concern of the implementer. Hence, rather than using an API (Application Programming Interface) to build an application, the student is asked to implement a given API. Topics include implementing classes (non-utilities, delegation within the class definition, documentation and API generation, implementing contracts), aggregations (implementing aggregates versus compositions and implementing collections), inheritance hierarchies (attribute visibility, overriding methods, abstract classes versus interfaces, inner classes);\napplications of aggregation and inheritance in concurrent programming and event-driven programming; recursion; searching and sorting including quick and merge sorts); stacks and queues; linked lists; binary trees. Three lecture hours and weekly laboratory sessions. Prerequisites: General Prerequisite; LE/EECS1021 3.00 or LE/EECS 1020 3.00 or LE/EECS1022 3.00 or LE/EECS 1720 3.00.  Course credit exclusions: LE/EECS1030 3.00, AP/ITEC 2620 3.00.  (NOTE: The General Prerequisite is a cumulative GPA of 4.50 or better over all major EECS courses.
